The .map files here were generated from "SYSTEM.IAS" which was in
turn generated from files obtained from Paul Pierce's site at:-
http://www.piercefuller.com/oldibm-shadow/709x.html
 
Each file (more or less) is a separate assembly deck for the IBM 7090/7094
IBSYS operating system. They were created by spliting the orginal tape
records at each occurance of $IBMAP (the assembler program).
There are some ifs and buts:-
 
The file names are based on the name following "$IBMAP". Some of these
included dots (full stops, periods). These have been changed to "_" to
create legal Linux filenames.
 
The last file in the original deck is incomplete.
It is just an incomplete duplicate of _iocs.map.
