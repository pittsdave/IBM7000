*      ....... DOUBLE-PRECISION FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS ON NUMBERS    
*              STORED IN CONSECUTIVE STORAGE LOCATIONS. OPERATIONS FAD  
*              FSB,FMP, AND FDP ARE PROVIDED. ALSO AVAILABLE IS A FDP   
*              WHEN THE DIVISOR IS SINGLE-PRECISION. THE ARGUMENTS ARE  
*              THE HIGH ORDER WORDS OF EACH OPERAND. THE LOW ORDER WORDS
*              ARE ASSUMED TO OCCUPY LOCATION Y + 1, IF THE HIGH ORDER  
*              WORD IS IN LOCATION Y. THIS IS THE STANDARD STORAGE
*              ALLOCATION FOR IBM 7094 HARDWARE DOUBLE-PRECISION OPER-  
*              ATION EXCEPT THAT THESE ROUTINES DO NOT REQUIRE THAT THE 
*              HIGH ORDER WORD BE IN AN EVEN LOCATION.

*                (1) THE TAGS ON THE OPERANDS MAY NOT BE 4. 
*                (2) THE OPERANDS MAY HAVE A TAG, BUT MAY NOT BE  
*                    INDIRECTLY ADDRESSED.
*                (3) THE *** IN THE OPERATION FIELD IS USED TO SHOW     
*                    THAT THESE OPERATIONS ARE ARBITRARY.   
*                (4) IF DIVISION BY ZERO IS ATTEMPTED AND DCEXIT HAS    
*                    NEVER BEEN CALLED, THEN A TRANSFER TO ERROR WILL   
*                    OCCUR. DCEXIT MAY BE CALLED ANY NUMBER OF TIMES,   
*                    THE LAST CALL ALWAYS BEING THE ONE IN CONTROL.     
*                (5) NOTE THAT NO ERASABLE STORAGE IS USED. 
*                (6) THE FLOATING ROUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED    
*                    REPRESENT THE RESULT OF EXTENSIVE TESTING. IT WAS  
*                    DESIRED THAT THEY ACHIEVE A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION    
*                    ABOUT THE EXACT ANSWER. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, HOWEVER
*                    , TO CLAIM THAT
*                         FL ( X'Y )  =  ( X'Y ) * ( 1+E )  
*                    WHERE /E/ .L. 2**-54. AT BEST IT MAY BE CLAIMED
